# Flood Escape Guidance App
This Android App is for guiding to an alternative location in case of floods

#Motivation
* Floods are one of the leading cause of death and property loss around the world
* The number of extreme rain incidents has increased in the last decade due to global warming
* This causes extremely high intensity floods
* It is extremely important to guide people out of a flood situation
* Since Mobile phones are the most prevalent technology available to people around the world, a mobile app is the best technological solution to tackle this problem

#What is it
The project involves building an app on android platform that will guide users to the nearest safest area based on land elevation

#What it does?
The app uses the users location and real time flood data on the web to guide people to safe, elevated areas in the event of a flood

#How it Works
The app is written with Android studio using Java. 
Android is used by 80% of world phones and the most popular platform
The code overlays map data from the phone GPS, google maps API, GDACS flood data API, Google maps elevation API, Google maps direction API and provide output guidance
It then finds the closest safe area to the users location with higher elevation
Computes the fastest route using google directions  and google elevation to guide the user to safety
